# VSE Computation Server Administration Readme

This is the repository for administering the graduate computation server at the Vancouver School of Economics. If you are looking for the server user manual, it's at [http://turtle.econ.ubc.ca/](http://turtle.econ.ubc.ca/). For questions about the server or server manual, you can email me at adlai.newson@gmail.com

If you are maintaining the server manual after I'm gone, just change the raw HTML file server_manual.html, then copy it to the root web server (if you don't have root access, ask Masaru to do it). 

ie: sudo cp server_manual.html /var/www/html/
