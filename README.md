# Server Manual Readme

This is the manual for the graduate computation server at the Vancouver School of Economics. For questions about the server or this manual, you can email me at adlai.newson@gmail.com

If you are maintaining this after I'm gone, just change the raw HTML file server_manual.html, then copy it to the root web server (if you don't have root access, ask Masaru to do it). 

ie: sudo cp server_manual.html /var/www/html/
